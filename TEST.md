Of course, I can help. This is a classic and highly challenging problem in computer vision known as **few-shot (or in your case, one-shot) learning**. Your diagnosis is correct: a standard ResNet50, even pre-trained, will fail catastrophically because it cannot learn to distinguish between 30+ classes when it has only seen one example for each. The model has no understanding of what variations are allowed within a single "outfit" class.

You need to change your entire approach from **classification** to **similarity learning** or **metric learning**.

Instead of asking the model, "Is this image 'outfit A'?", you will ask, "How similar is this new image to the reference image I have for 'outfit A'?"

Here is a breakdown of what you should do, from the most crucial steps to more advanced techniques.

### The Core Problem: Why Your Current Approach Fails

A standard classifier learns a *decision boundary* to separate classes. With one image, it learns to recognize that *exact image* and nothing else. If a new photo of the same outfit is taken from a different angle, in different lighting, or with a slightly different pose, the model will have no idea it's the same outfit because it has never been taught to generalize.

### The Solution: A Metric Learning Strategy

We will use the pre-trained ResNet50 not as a classifier, but as a powerful **feature extractor**. We'll use it to convert each image into a rich numerical representation (an "embedding" vector). The goal is to train this feature extractor so that images of the same outfit produce very similar vectors, and images of different outfits produce very different vectors.

The most practical and effective architecture for this is a **Siamese Network**.

#### What is a Siamese Network?

A Siamese Network consists of two identical neural networks (two "twin" ResNet50s that share the exact same weights).

1.  **Training:** You feed it a *pair* of images.
      * If the images are of the **same outfit** (a "positive pair"), you train the network to output similar embedding vectors for them.
      * If the images are of **different outfits** (a "negative pair"), you train the network to output dissimilar embedding vectors.
2.  **Prediction (Inference):** Once the network is trained, you use just one of the "twin" networks.
      * First, you pre-compute and save the embedding vector for each of your 30+ reference outfit images.
      * When a new, unknown image arrives, you pass it through the network to get its embedding vector.
      * You then compare this new vector to all your saved reference vectors using a distance metric (like Euclidean distance or Cosine similarity).
      * The predicted outfit is the one corresponding to the reference vector with the smallest distance (i.e., the most similar).

### Your Action Plan: Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Aggressive Data Augmentation (Absolutely Critical)

Since you only have one image per class, you must create "fake" variations of it. This is the only way to form the "positive pairs" needed for training.

Use `torchvision.transforms` to create a strong augmentation pipeline. For each image, you'll generate multiple augmented versions.

```python
import torchvision.transforms as T

# Create a strong augmentation pipeline
augmentation_pipeline = T.Compose([
    T.Resize((256, 256)),
    T.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    T.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    T.ColorJitter(brightness=0.4, contrast=0.4, saturation=0.4, hue=0.1),
    T.RandomGrayscale(p=0.2),
    T.RandomResizedCrop(size=224, scale=(0.8, 1.0)),
    T.ToTensor(),
    T.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

#### Step 2: Build the Siamese Network

You'll use ResNet50 as the core "backbone". You will remove its final classification layer (`fc`) and replace it with a new "head" that projects the features into your desired embedding space (e.g., a 128-dimensional vector).

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

class SiameseNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim=128):
        super(SiameseNet, self).__init__()
        
        # Use a pre-trained ResNet50 as the backbone
        self.backbone = models.resnet50(weights=models.ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT)
        
        # Freeze early layers (as you asked before!)
        # This helps maintain the powerful, general features learned from ImageNet
        for name, param in self.backbone.named_parameters():
            if "layer4" not in name and "fc" not in name:
                param.requires_grad = False
        
        # Get the number of input features for the classifier
        in_features = self.backbone.fc.in_features
        
        # Replace the final classification layer with an embedding head
        self.backbone.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(in_features, 512),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(512, embedding_dim)
        )

    def forward_one(self, x):
        """Passes one image through the backbone to get its embedding."""
        return self.backbone(x)

    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        """Passes a pair of images through the network."""
        out1 = self.forward_one(x1)
        out2 = self.forward_one(x2)
        return out1, out2
```

#### Step 3: Create the Dataset and Loss Function

You'll need a custom `Dataset` that yields pairs of images and a label indicating if they are from the same class (1) or different classes (0).

For the loss function, you'll use **Contrastive Loss**. This loss function pushes the embeddings from positive pairs closer together and pulls the embeddings from negative pairs further apart.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=2.0):
        super(ContrastiveLoss, self).__init__()
        self.margin = margin

    def forward(self, output1, output2, label):
        # Calculate the euclidean distance between the two embeddings
        euclidean_distance = F.pairwise_distance(output1, output2, keepdim=True)
        
        # Calculate the loss
        loss_contrastive = torch.mean(
            (label) * torch.pow(euclidean_distance, 2) +
            (1 - label) * torch.pow(torch.clamp(self.margin - euclidean_distance, min=0.0), 2)
        )
        return loss_contrastive

```

During training, for each image in your batch:

  * Create a **positive pair**: (original\_image, augmented\_version\_of\_same\_image). The label is `1`.
  * Create a **negative pair**: (original\_image, a randomly chosen image of a *different* outfit). The label is `0`.

#### Step 4: The Training and Prediction Workflow

**Training:**

1.  Initialize your `SiameseNet`, `ContrastiveLoss`, and an optimizer.
2.  In your training loop, for each step:
      * Get a batch of image pairs and labels.
      * Pass the pairs through the Siamese network to get two sets of embeddings.
      * Calculate the contrastive loss.
      * Backpropagate and update the weights (only the unfrozen ones: `layer4` and the new `fc` head).

**Prediction:**

1.  Put your trained `SiameseNet` in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).
2.  Create a "reference gallery" by passing each of your 30 original, non-augmented outfit images through the network to get their 30 reference embeddings. Store these.
3.  When a new image comes in:
      * Apply the necessary transformations (without the random augmentations).
      * Pass it through the network to get its embedding.
      * Calculate the distance between this new embedding and all 30 reference embeddings.
      * The prediction is the outfit corresponding to the reference embedding with the smallest distance.

### Summary: Why this works

  * **You don't need much data:** The model learns a general concept of "sameness" for outfits, not the specifics of 30+ classes.
  * **It's scalable:** If you get a 31st outfit, you don't need to retrain the whole model. You just compute the reference embedding for the new outfit and add it to your gallery.
  * **It leverages pre-training:** You still benefit from the powerful features of ResNet50 learned on ImageNet.

This approach transforms your problem from an impossible classification task into a feasible similarity matching task, which is the right way to handle one-shot learning scenarios.
